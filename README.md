# üëã Hi, I'm Mohamed Farouk

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on **Natural Language Processing**, **LLMs**, and **deploying real-world AI applications**. I thrive at the intersection of backend systems and modern ML solutions‚Äîbringing intelligent systems to life through scalable, optimized, and production-ready code.

## üß† Who Am I?

I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering graduate and AWS-trained ML Engineer with hands-on experience in designing and deploying AI systems across NLP, data pipelines, and backend services. My passion lies in building solutions that make complex models accessible and useful‚Äîfrom RAG-based assistants to fine-tuned SQL translators. With a foundation in algorithmic thinking and a flair for clean, scalable backend architecture, I aim to bridge the gap between research and production.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Can I Do for You?

- **üß© NLP-Powered Solutions**: Build chatbots, semantic search engines, job description generators, Text-to-SQL translators, and more using LangChain, HuggingFace, and custom pipelines.
- **üöÄ ML Deployment**: Deploy optimized models on AWS using Docker, FastAPI, and REST APIs for low-latency, scalable access.
- **üß™ Model Optimization**: Apply LoRA, quantization (4-bit/8-bit), and pruning to fine-tune and compress large models without compromising performance.
- **üîó Backend Integration**: Combine ML models with Django, Flask, or FastAPI APIs to create complete web-based AI platforms.
- **üï∏ Data Acquisition & Automation**: Create scalable data pipelines and web scraping scripts using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and automation tools.
